Execute the program: ./gradlew main --args="<path_to_your_bpmn_file> <IAT>"

Possible combinations of a task which creates only dependencies between the elected task and other tasks:
    - A task can be put in parallel of the set of abstract graphs of the current cluster
    - A task can be put in sequence at the beginning/end of any combination of abstract graphs of size >= 2

    - A task can be put in parallel of any ordered combination of node of each abstract graph of the cluster
    - A task can be put in sequence at the beginning/end or between each node of each abstract graph of the cluster

    - A task can be put in sequence at the beginning/end of any combination of task/subgraph of any abstract node

    - For choices:
        - Generate all combinations for each path of the choice
        - Make a cartesian product between all combinations of each path to generate the entire set of combinations

    - For loops:
        - Do not do anything
